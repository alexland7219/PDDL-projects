# Can you solve the river crossing riddle?

TED Original Riddle: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADR7dUoVh_c&t=49s

- Initially three lions and three wildebeests (from now on, gnus) are on one side of the river.
- There's only one raft to get across, and no animal can get across without the raft.
- The raft, obviously, cannot sail without any animal onboard.
- The raft has a maximum capacity of two animals.
- If the lions ever outnumber the gnus on either side of the river (including the animals in the raft
if it's on that side), they'll eat the gnus.
- In the end, all animals have to get across the river.
